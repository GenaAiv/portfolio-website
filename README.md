# Gena's website
## My personal portfolio website
I made this website with the idea to showcase the skills and knowledge that I have built up over the past months.

The site is running on Node's Express.js and is having a React front-end. Express is serving the static build that is generated by Webpack

Inside my React app, I chose to use Bootstrap and SCSS for styling.
